                    <img src="./images/brazilian_couscous.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>
                    <h3>Couscous Recipe</h3>
                    The Brazilian Couscous from the Northeast Region also known as Corn Couscous is a nutritious,
                    cheap and a really simple recipe to make. It is a North African dish brought to Brazil by
                    Portuguese colonizers.
                    <br>
                    It is a steamed corn meal recipe, and it will look like a cake, if you use a steamer basket. If
                    you do not have a steamer you can cook it on a deep plate (‚Äúcuscuz no prato‚Äù).
                    It is an essential part of the typical Brazilian northeastern breakfast, and is served almost at
                    every meal ‚Äì in some places it is also used as an alternative for bread.
                    The Coconut Couscous is the sweet version of this recipe, enriched with coconut and sugar. There
                    are also other regional versions like Portuguese Couscous and Tapioca Couscous, but they are
                    very different dishes.
                    <br>
                    Ingredients
                    <br>
                    250 g pre cooked flaked corn flour or pre cooked corn flour
                    1 teaspoon salt
                    1 tablespoon manioc starch
                    400 ml water, approximately
                    <br>
                    Preparation method
                    <br>
                    Mix the corn flour, manioc starch and salt, together, in a bowl.
                    Gradually add the water and mix well until all ingredients are moist and mixture has a crumbly
                    texture. Let it stand for 10 minutes. Manioc starch makes the couscous more compact, but you can
                    also prepare the recipe without it.
                    Fill the steamer pot half full of water.
                    <br>
                    Place the couscous mixture into the steamer basket and gently level the top without pressing.
                    The mixture should remain soft to allow the steam to penetrate just right.
                    Cover and cook over low heat for about 15 minutes, until it begins to release its aroma. At this
                    point the mixture starts to pull away from the sides of the steamer.
                    <br>
                    Cut into slices and serve hot. Add butter, molasses, coconut milk or milk (hot or cold,
                    sweetened or unsweetened), if you like. It is a very versatile side dish to vegetables, meat,
                    fish, eggs, cheese, coconut and sweet courses.
                    <br>
                    How to steam couscous with a deep plate (or pot lid)
                    Transfer the couscous mixture to a deep plate that has a larger diameter than the pot diameter.
                    Wrap the deep plate with a clean cloth, making a knot on the bottom of the plate. Fill the pot
                    one third full of water, bring to a boil and ‚Äúcover‚Äù the pot with the wrapped deep plate (the
                    couscous mixture must be facing downwards). Simmer over low heat for 10-15 minutes. Serve the
                    couscous hot straight from the ‚Äúcooking plate‚Äù. ;
                    <br>
                    Variation: You can add diced ‚Äúqueijo de coalho‚Äù or fresh cheese on top before starting cooking.

                    Yield: 4-6 servings.

                    <br>
                    Bai√£o is a traditional style of music from Northeastern Brazil. This music evolved as a combination
                    of the music of the indigenous people in that region and that of African and European immigrants
                    (just like the cuisine!). Bai√£o is also the name of a folk dance from this region, and so the name
                    of this dish literally means "baiao (dance) for two".
                    <br>
                    Bai√£o become very popular in the mid 20th century, and around that time a pair of musicians wrote a
                    popular song called "bai√£o-de-dois" that became associated with this dish.
                    <br>
                    Bai√£o-de-dois is best when made with fresh black-eyed peas, which can be hard to find but are
                    usually available in the frozen food section. In Brazil, this dish is often prepared with dried beef
                    (carne de sol) but pork (bacon in this case) is also popular.
                    <br>
                    Ingredients
                    4 slices bacon
                    1 medium onion, chopped
                    4 cloves garlic
                    1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus 1 tablespoon
                    2 cups fresh (or frozen) black-eyed peas
                    2 cups water
                    1 1/4 cups rice
                    1 cup vegetable or chicken stock
                    Salt and pepper to taste
                    8 ounces smoked mozzarella (or regular whole milk mozzarella) cheese
                    <br>
                    Steps to Make It
                    <br>
                    Coarsely chop the bacon and place it in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Cook until bacon is
                    browned and crispy. Remove about 1/4 of the bacon pieces and set aside for garnish.
                    <br>
                    Add the chopped onion to the saucepan and cook over medium heat in the bacon grease until softened.
                    Add the garlic and the chopped cilantro and cook for several minutes more, stirring.
                    <br>
                    Add the black-eyed peas and the water to the saucepan. Cover and simmer until black-eyed peas are
                    tender, about 30 to 40 minutes.
                    <br>
                    Once the beans are tender, stir in the rice and 1 cup of vegetable or chicken stock. Cover and
                    simmer over low heat until rice is cooked. Check periodically and add more stock if needed. Season
                    with salt and pepper to taste.
                    <br>
                    Cut the mozzarella cheese into 1-inch cubes. Stir into the dish just before serving, so cheese has
                    time to melt slightly.

                    <h3>Cear√°-Style Moqueca Recipe</h3>
                    Ingredients:
                    <br>
                    1 pound (450g) of firm white fish (such as snapper or grouper), cut into chunks
                    1 pound (450g) of shrimp, peeled and deveined
                    1 onion, finely chopped
                    2 cloves of garlic, minced
                    1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
                    1 green bell pepper, thinly sliced
                    2 tomatoes, diced
                    1/4 cup of fresh cilantro, chopped
                    1/4 cup of fresh parsley, chopped
                    2 tablespoons of olive oil
                    1 can (13.5 oz) of coconut milk
                    1 tablespoon of red palm oil (optional)
                    1 lime, juiced
                    Salt and pepper to taste
                    1/2 cup of fish or shrimp broth (optional)
                    <br>
                    Instructions:
                    <br>
                    In a large, deep skillet or a traditional clay pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the
                    chopped onion and garlic, saut√© until translucent.
                    <br>
                    Add the red and green bell peppers and cook for a few minutes until they start to soften.
                    <br>
                    Stir in the diced tomatoes and cook for a couple of minutes until they release their juices.
                    <br>
                    Add the fish and shrimp to the pot, and season with salt and pepper. Cook for a few minutes until
                    the seafood starts to turn opaque.
                    <br>
                    Pour in the coconut milk, and if you have it, the red palm oil. Stir well to combine, and let it
                    simmer for about 10-15 minutes, or until the seafood is cooked through and the sauce thickens.
                    <br>
                    If desired, add the fish or shrimp broth to adjust the consistency of the sauce.
                    <br>
                    Stir in the lime juice, fresh cilantro, and parsley. Adjust the seasoning as needed.
                    <br>
                    Serve the Cear√°-Style Moqueca hot, traditionally with steamed rice or cassava flour.
                    <br>
                    Brief Origin Summary:
                    <br>
                    Cear√°-Style Moqueca, often called "Moqueca Cearense," is a traditional dish from the northeastern
                    state of Cear√° in Brazil. It's a regional variation of the more famous "Moqueca Baiana" from Bahia.
                    The dish is characterized by its use of coconut milk and locally available ingredients, resulting in
                    a rich and flavorful seafood stew. The warm climate of Cear√° is reflected in its vibrant and
                    aromatic flavors. It's a delightful fusion of African, Indigenous, and Portuguese culinary
                    influences, making it a beloved part of the Brazilian gastronomic tapestry.

                    <h3>Figures from northeastern folklore</h3>
                    <p>
                        Padim Ci√ßo: Padre C√≠cero Rom√£o Batista, commonly known as Padim Ci√ßo, is one of the most famous
                        figures in Cear√° folklore. He was a Catholic priest who played a significant role in the
                        religious and social life of the region. He is considered a folk saint by many, and his image
                        and influence continue to be important in Cear√°.
                        <br>
                        Lampi√£o and Maria Bonita: While not originally from Cear√° but rather from the neighboring state
                        of Pernambuco, Lampi√£o and Maria Bonita are legendary figures in the folklore of the entire
                        Northeast region of Brazil. Lampi√£o was a bandit leader, and Maria Bonita was his partner in
                        crime. They became folk heroes and are often romanticized in songs and stories.
                        <br>
                        Jurema: Jurema is a mystical and powerful figure in Cear√° folklore. She is often associated with
                        traditional indigenous and African spiritual practices. Jurema ceremonies involve the
                        consumption of a hallucinogenic drink, and they play a significant role in the spiritual and
                        cultural life of some Cear√° communities.
                        <br>
                        Bumba-Meu-Boi: The Bumba-Meu-Boi is a popular folk festival that features a colorful and lively
                        cast of characters, including the Ox (Boi), the master of ceremonies (Pai de Santo), and various
                        other participants. The festival combines music, dance, and storytelling and is celebrated
                        throughout Cear√°.
                        <br>
                        Cangaceiros: Cangaceiros were outlaws and bandits who roamed the hinterlands of the Northeast,
                        including Cear√°, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They were known for their
                        distinctive clothing, including wide-brimmed hats and leather canteens. Lampi√£o, mentioned
